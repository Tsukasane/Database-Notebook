# Database-Notebook
For BNU Online&amp;Offline Course

Hi there! If you are green hand to database, welcome to use my note. 
It contains some key points I jotted down from course materials and exercises that I think are of help to understanding those trivial concepts. Several tips come from [here](https://blog.csdn.net/lic1697067085/article/details/122471733)(Heartily grateful!).

I recommand you to use the '.md' files, which can be easily get by downloading this repo. It's convenient to modify as you may want to add your own part.
